# PyWhatsappAccountChecker
A simple python script to find out if a number is linked with a WhatsApp account, using selenium.

Hello, thanks for downloading my script!
To use the script you have to install selenium via pip or manually.


HOW TO USE:
Put the phone numbers in list.txt, start the script and enjoy this TOS breaking monstrosity :))!

IF IT'S TAKING TOO LONG OR ALL THE NUMBERS RESULT NON EXISTING, TRY CHANGING THE SLEEP() TIME


!!! WARNING !!!
I don't take any responsability for bans or problems the script may cause you!
